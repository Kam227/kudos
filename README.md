### Reflection

* Did the topics discussed in your labs prepare you to complete the assignment? Be specific, which features in your weekly assignment did you feel unprepared to complete?

Yes, the lectures were helpful, especially the rescheduled Postgres lecture, which was crucial for starting the project. While I didn't feel unprepared, the instructions could have been clearer.

* If you had more time, what would you have done differently? Would you have added additional features? Changed the way your project responded to a particular event, etc.
  
If I had more time, I would enhance the comments section by adding user icons and other features to make it more engaging. Currently, it only allows users to leave text, which makes it feel somewhat bland.

* Reflect on your project demo, what went well? Were there things that maybe didn't go as planned? Did you notice something that your peer did that you would like to try next time?

My project demo went well as expected, with no technical issues. However, I noticed that my peers demonstrated more creativity in their styling and CSS. I plan to take inspiration from them for future projects.
